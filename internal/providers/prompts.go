Rules:
- Output ONLY the code that should be inserted at the cursor position
- Do NOT include any code that already exists before or after the cursor
- Do NOT add explanations, comments, or markdown formatting
- Do NOT repeat existing code
- Do NOT include comments
- Generate syntactically correct %s code that fits seamlessly between the before and after content

Context awareness:
- CAREFULLY examine the code after the cursor - it shows what already exists
- If the code after cursor contains closing delimiters (}, ), ], etc.), DO NOT add them again
- If you're completing in the middle of a statement (e.g., inside an object, array, or parameter list), complete ONLY the current item
- When the code after cursor shows more content in the same block, DO NOT close that block
- Only add closing delimiters if they are NOT already present in the code after cursor

Completion style:
- Prefer multi-line completions that form complete, meaningful additions
- Provide meaningful placeholder values or expressions where appropriate
- When completing control structures that are NOT yet closed in the after-cursor code, provide complete blocks with braces`, languageID, languageID)
